    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>"I was born in Saint-Petersburg, Russia in 2004, I have been lived there for 17 years. First 7 grades I was studying in English-Japanese school. 8 and 9 grades I was studying in Physics and Maths academy. Last 2 grades I finished in 1 year and got 5.0 GPA. Also, I have played chess and tennis for 10 and 8 years. My parents always supported me in my hobbies so that is why I had a lot of sports and intellectual activities in my childhood. Such as football, basketball, swimming, ice skating, judo, history and biological classes in free time from school. "</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>"I was playing chess for 10 years got Candidate of masters in blitz(it’s quick chess). Also, I won some championships and in the age of 16 years old finished my chess career. During this period I have been playing tennis too. The same situation, few won tournament-ships, however, my knees was worn down with the tennis and I retired."</p>
    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>"I’ve always been a very sociable person so I’ve had a lot of friends and was always surrounded by smart and good people I could talk to. However,  8 month ago I made a difficult decision to move to Azerbaijan and leave all my friends in Saint-Petersburg. So unfortunately, now my personal life is not quite full but I am trying to make it all up and find friends here. Moreover I visit many interesting places in Baku, I walk a lot and go on excursions. (In conclusion, I would like to say that I am happy to be here and studying at ADA University, I am open to new acquaintances.)"</p>
