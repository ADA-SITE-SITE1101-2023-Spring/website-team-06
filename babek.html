    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>"I was born in 2004 on November 21 in Russia. There I went to school number 37. There were many hobbies at an early age. I played with my friends almost every day. We played football, basketball, skated and so on. I was very noisy and hyperactive. In addition, I was very interested in encyclopedias. At the age of 7-8 years, I had already finished 2 encyclopedias. Facts about plants, animals and especially astronomy were very interesting to me at the age of 8-9. My early age was quite interesting and developing."</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>"When we moved to Azerbaijan, I went to school number 177 and graduated from it. Since 6th grade I started to plan my future job and career. Firstly, I decided to be a lawyer. FInally, at 8th grade I completely made my mind about my job: computer scientist. I studied hard and wanted all my university classes to be in English. That's one of the main reasons why I entered the ADA University. Here I study as a computer science student and learn everything about programming for my future job. I hope I will be a demanded person in the future."</p>
    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
    <p>"I love to improve myself and play football. Every time we have free time with friends, we do not miss the opportunity to play football. Moreover, I recently started to play 8 ball with my friends. Besides, I have hobbies like reading, watching movies and learning new things. I want to participate in the events such as Formula 1, because it is a great opportunity to make foreign friends and improve your language. I am very sociable and supportive. One of my main purposes of life is being a person, with whom everyone can be friendly and rely."</p>
